# YouTube Timestamp-helper

YouTube Timestamp-helper is a Chrome extension that makes it easy to turn any YouTube video into structured, reusable notes.

Instead of juggling a notepad, description box, and the seek bar, you get a dedicated side panel for:

- **Labeled timestamp management**  
  Add timestamps with custom labels while watching. Perfect for lectures, long podcasts, live archives, and song breakdowns.

- **Section loop playback (A–B repeat)**  
  Set a start and end point to loop a specific section, so you can repeatedly practice a phrase, solo, or tricky part.

- **One-click timestamp list export**  
  Copy a clean list of timestamps (with labels and time-linked URLs) ready for YouTube descriptions, comments, or notes.
